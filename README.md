# Water Management System for Indore
Project for HackNDore organized by Indore Municipal Corporation.
## Overview

This project, developed for HackNDore organized by the Indore Municipal Corporation, focuses on analyzing and improving the water management system for Indore. It consists of several components organized into different folders for structured development and analysis.

## Project Structure

### 1. `Gemini-api-code`
This folder contains the code for the Gemini API. This API may be trained and utilized in the future to enhance the models and analysis.

### 2. `dataofGraphs`
This folder holds all the data used by the models. It is subdivided into three folders:

- **`ml_model_csv`**: Contains CSV files used by the machine learning models present in the `models` folder.
- **`old_ward`**: Includes data for all 84 wards detailing the number of colonies, used in `all_wards_data.py` and `compare_old_newwards.py`.
- **`ward`**: Contains updated colony data for all 84 wards reflecting the new pipeline system, used in `all_wards_data.py` and `compare_old_newwards.py`.

### 3. `generators`
This folder includes all the generators used for creating and processing the CSV files.

### 4. `image_result`
Contains output images generated by the models, which visualize the results and insights obtained from the analysis.

### 5. `models`
Holds all the models used in the project, including one machine learning model that is not yet well-trained.

## Usage

1. **API Integration**: Utilize the Gemini API code for advanced data analysis and model training.
2. **Data Handling**: Access and manipulate data through the CSV files in `dataofGraphs`, update and compare ward data as needed.
3. **Model Application**: Use the models in the `models` folder for predictions and analysis, and review the output images in `image_result`.

## Notes

- Ensure the CSV files in `ml_model_csv` are correctly formatted for compatibility with the machine learning models.
- The `old_ward` and `ward` folders contain crucial data for comparison and analysis, reflecting historical and current data.
